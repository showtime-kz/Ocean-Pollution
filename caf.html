            many different things that cause ocean pollution and with ocean pollution becoming a bigger concern in turn the effects 
            have more and more impacts. This page will explain the many different causes of ocean pollution and the various effects that 
            this has on marine life and even humans.

                <h2>Causes</h2>
                <p>There are various factors that cause ocean pollution and one of the main causes is single-use plastics.
                    It causes ocean pollution because the wind can carry the rubbish; which most of the time is plastic
                    which takes hundereds of years to biodegrade, then in turn staying in the ocean and polluting it for hundereds of years. Another
                    cause is runoff which is caused by water not absorbing in the land carrying toxic substances and flowing into the ocean and other 
                    bodies of water.

                <h2>Effects</h2>
                <p>With many causes there also comes many effects. Ocean pollution affects marine animals and their habitats.
                    Ocean debris can kill off marine species if they ingest or become tangled in the debris. Another effect 
                    of ocean pollution is the debris can enter the food chain. Marine animals sometime mistake plastic floating in the 
                    sea as food. This ends up in the animal eventually ending up in humans as seafood is a primary food source for humans.
