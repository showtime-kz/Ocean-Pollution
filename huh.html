                <h2>Avoid single-use Plastics</h2>
                <p>Single use plastics is one of the main causes of ocean pollution due to the fact that it doesn't break down for hundereds of years. Single
                    use plastics include plastic straws, plastic bags and plastic bags etc. Consider using environmentally friendly things instead such as reusable
                    bags, paper straws etc.

                <h2>Reduce Chemical Pollutants</h2>
                <p>When chemical pollutants are released into the ocean, the excess nutrients can trigger algae
                    blooms which takes the water's oxygen leading to dead zones where not much marine life
                    can live. Examples of everyday products that have chemical pollutants are laundry detergents, 
                    dishwashing tablets etc. Switch to natural products.

                <h2>Avoid products with Micro-Plastics</h2>
                <p>Micro-Plastics are pieces of plastic that has been broken up into smaller pieces. This is bad because
                    it can end up in the human body causing health problems. Products that contain microplastics include:
                    Sunscreen, facial cleansers and more. Switch to zero-waste alternatives.

                <p>Synthetic clothing also contains microplastics that can end up in the human body and cause health problems. 
                    To help this buy clothes that are made up of only natural fabrics.

                <h2>Reduce, Reuse, Recyle</h2>
                <p>Reduce waste material by asking yourself if you really need it, how long it is going to last and if it is going 
                    to affect the environment. Reuse waste material by repurposing it or reusing it. Recycle the rest of the waste
                    so that the companies can reuse the waste material.
